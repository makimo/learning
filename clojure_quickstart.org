* Clojure REPL quickstart

There are a few options on how you can start playing with Clojure.
Choose one that suits you.

** Install Leiningen

Leiningen is what npm is for JavaScript. You can install it in a couple of
ways:

*** From repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt install leiningen
#+END_SRC

*** Directly

Follow istructions given here: https://leiningen.org/

** Install Clojure

*** From repository (Linux)

On many Linux distributions, installation is as easy as installing
single ~clojure~ package. For example, on Ubuntu:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt install clojure
#+END_SRC

*** Via script installer (Linux)

To install with the Linux installer:

1. Ensure that the following dependencies are installed: bash, curl, rlwrap, and Java.
2. Use the linux-install script to download and run the install, which will
   create /usr/local/bin/clj, /usr/local/bin/clojure, and /usr/local/lib/clojure:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.1.561.sh
   chmod +x linux-install-1.10.1.561.sh
   sudo ./linux-install-1.10.1.561.sh
   #+END_SRC

*** Via Homebrew (MacOS)

Install the command line tools with brew from the clojure/tools tap:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew install clojure/tools/clojure
#+END_SRC

If youâ€™ve already installed, you can upgrade to the latest release with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew upgrade clojure/tools/clojure
#+END_SRC

*** Installation on Windows

An early release version of clj on Windows is available at clj on Windows.
Please provide feedback at https://clojure.atlassian.net/projects/TDEPS.

*** Local build

Download and build Clojure from source (requires Git, Java, and Maven):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/clojure/clojure.git
cd clojure
mvn -Plocal -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
#+END_SRC

Then start the REPL with the local jar:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
java -jar clojure.jar
#+END_SRC

*** Try Clojure online

repl.it provides a browser-based Clojure repl for interactive exploration.

** Via Docker

Assuming you've Docker installed, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --rm -it clojure lein repl
#+END_SRC

** Starting REPL

If you've installed Lein, start REPL with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lein repl
#+END_SRC

If you've installed Clojure directly, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
clojure
#+END_SRC
